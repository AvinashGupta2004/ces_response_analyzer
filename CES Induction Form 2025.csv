--One monitor disabled

--Only allowed to use 10 lines of code

--Word Ban: You can't use certain common keywords (like if, for, else, var, or even print). You must find a workaround using logic (e.g., ternary operators, recursion).

Team Collaboration: I’ve worked in diverse team setups during hackathons and project builds, where communication and coordination played a vital role.

Consistency: I follow a disciplined daily routine and dedicate focused time to learning, building projects, and personality growth.
","Perfectionism: I sometimes spend too much time polishing small details in my code or designs, which can delay overall progress. I’m learning to prioritize tasks better and focus on delivering functional results first.

Be Proactive: If any issues arise, I’ll inform the concerned seniors immediately and propose alternative solutions without waiting till the last minute.","Open Communication: I’ll encourage honest and respectful conversations so that everyone feels heard and valued.

Clear Roles and Responsibilities: I’ll ensure that every team member, including myself, clearly understands their tasks to prevent overlap or confusion.

Stay Objective and Calm: If disagreements arise, I’ll focus on facts and solutions instead of personal opinions or emotions or biasness.

Listen Actively: I’ll make an effort to understand other perspectives before responding, which often prevents conflicts from escalating.

Encourage Collaboration: I’ll foster a collaborative environment where helping each other is more important than competing.

Involve a Mediator if Needed: If the issue persists, I won’t hesitate to seek guidance from seniors or mentors to resolve it peacefully and quickly.

I like to give myself mini-deadlines before the actual due date so I have enough time to review or handle any unexpected issues.  I also make it a priority. I focus on the task early and consistently, rather than leaving things for the last minute. That helps me manage my time more effectively.  Throughout the process, I keep my seniors updated.

I’d encourage everyone to listen to each other and value different viewpoints—it keeps disagreements from turning personal. If I sense any tension, I’d step in right away, have a calm chat, and sort it out before it grows. To build a tight-knit vibe, I’d plan some fun team hangouts or casual check-ins to keep us connected.
